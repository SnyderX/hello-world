# hello-world
Just a start-out repository.

I'm a student, just transferred to Rowan going for my bachelors degree in computer science.
I have an associates in video game design, and have worked as both a programming and team lead/developer
in charge of 30+ classmates in order to make a full fledged (though small) game from scratch to sales.

I hope one day to getmyself more integrated in the video game business and to make a full publicly sold
and marketed game of my own.
